# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/msshahid21/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/MLR.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The variables that provided a non-random amount variation were vehicle_length and ground_clearance, as they are shown to have a statistically significant impact on the mpg of the MechaCar.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- As there are two variables shown to have a statistically significant impact on the mpg of the MechaCar, vehicle_length and ground_clearance, the slope of the linear model can be considered to be non-zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Yes, the linear model constructed is able to explain 71% of the variation in the mpg (R-Squared Value of 0.7149)

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Lot Summary

![Total Summary](https://github.com/msshahid21/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/TotalSummary.png)

The PSI of the Suspensions amongst all the lots have a variance below the 100 pounds per square inch benchmark at 62.29 pounds per square inch.

### Lot Summary

On the other hand, when drilling down, it can be seen that Lot 1 and Lot 2 both meet the benchmark of being below the 100 pounds per square inch PSI at 0.98 and 7.47 respectively, while Lot 3 fails by a substantial amount with 170 pounds per square inch of variance.
