# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/msshahid21/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/MLR.png)

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The variables that provided a non-random amount variation were vehicle_length and ground_clearance, as they are shown to have a statistically significant impact on the mpg of the MechaCar.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- As there are two variables shown to have a statistically significant impact on the mpg of the MechaCar, vehicle_length and ground_clearance, the slope of the linear model can be considered to be non-zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Yes, the linear model constructed is able to explain 71% of the variation in the mpg (R-Squared Value of 0.7149)
